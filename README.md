# Description
This is a simple state management app I create while learning Flutter to join a DevFest HCMC 2021.
In this app, it lists all the products in the store with product name, product price and a button to add that product to cart.Also, on the app bar, it has an icon to access cart. In the cart, we can see all product which user was added to cart.
